# SimPySSG

Not to be confused with ![pyssg](https://github.com/luevano/pyssg), this is a very simple python static site generator, designed to make blogging **as easy as possible.**

It includes a special implementation of Markdown (By Me, of course, because *I am totally **not** reinventing the wheel*) Parser (Without HTML support). This implementation includes syntactic sugar to make your life much easier by converting things in markdown that need HTML tags to custom tags in custom delimiters, so your pinky and index finger won't hurt when typing angle brackets for 4 hours a day.

It (should) include support for parsing entire folders with subfolders into HTML, ready for production.
Jinja2 support is projected.
